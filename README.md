# Gooboo And Looboo

Gooboo and Looboo is a local co-op game about trusting your friend, and working together to escape the ravine!

Story: Gooboo and Looboo are two one-of-a-kind siblings. They're different in almost every way imagineable, except for the fact that neither will go down without a fight. One day, while Gooboo and Looboo were playing outside,
they got into a huge fight. Since they were too busy fighting, they didn't notice that the cliff they were standing on had started to crumble. The floor fell out from beneath Looboo, and Gooboo leapt in after. 
Down and down they both fell into the ravine, landing in some old, abandoned mineshafts. Unfortunately for Gooboo and Looboo, these mineshafts were built for a team of miners to navigate, which meant that they'd need to put 
aside their differences and work together if they wanted to escape...
